            <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>
            Hi, I'm William Henderson, and I'm a Software Developer from the UK. I've been programming since I was just eight and using professional languages such as Python since I was ten, and since then I've designed, developed, tested and released several challenging projects across a range of languages.

            <h1>My Technologies</h1>
            Having been programming for the best part of a decade, I've become very proficient with a number of languages and tools, and developed a solid understanding of even more.

            <h1>My Skills</h1>
            As well as my broad knowledge of many technologies, I bring several other valuable skills to the table. These include the following:

            <h1>My Favourite Projects</h1>
            Over my many years of software development, I've worked on hundreds of projects, some lasting just days and others continuing to be supported months or even years after their creation. Here are some of my favourites!
            <div class="projectsShowcase">
                <div class="project" onclick="openGitHub('Unlimited-YouTube-Search');">
                    <span class="title">Unlimited YouTube Search</span>
                    <span class="lang">Python</span>
                    UYTS (Unlimited YouTube Search) is a small Python library I created to search YouTube without the need for its heavily restrictive Data API v3.
                </div>
                <div class="project" onclick="openGitHub('TidesX');">
                    <span class="title">TidesX</span>
                    <span class="lang">JavaScript</span>
                    TidesX is a quick and easy web app to check the tide times. It features tide times and predicted heights for 700+ locations, sun and moon information, and more, all inside a beautiful and efficient interface.
                </div>
                <div class="project" onclick="openGitHub('Othello');">
                    <span class="title">Othello</span>
                    <span class="lang">TypeScript</span>
                    For a CS project, I was tasked with implementing the classic game Othello. I chose to write an Electron app in TypeScript, complete with online multiplayer and a challenging AI to compete against.
                </div>
                <div class="project" onclick="openGitHub('EMC-Solar-Sailors');">
                    <span class="title">Solar Sailors</span>
                    <span class="lang">Python</span>
                    As part of my Exeter Mathematics Certificate, I worked in a group of five developing a simulation of a solar sail going to Mars. This involved writing a basic physics engine in Python as well as team work.
                </div>
                <div class="project" onclick="openGitHub('FreeTube-Music');">
                    <span class="title">FreeTube Music</span>
                    <span class="lang">JavaScript</span>
                    After being frustrated by YouTube Music charging money just to listen in the background, I wrote my own version built around YouTube's iframe API, which I still use to listen to music today.
